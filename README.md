# atteventify_firstprojectt
my first project in github.The purpose of our project, Atteventify, derived from the words 'Attendance' and 'Simplify,' is to simplify attendance tracking and event management. This application serves as an event management system designed to track and record attendance for events, thereby saving time and energy.
